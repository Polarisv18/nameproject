            <p class="review-text">cộng, despite being labeled the corporate stigma, is consistently curated and well-themed across their multiple stores,</p>
            <p class="review-text">and the one in nha trang, on the street of nguyen thien thuat, has long been my absolute favorite place to linger.</p>
            <p class="review-text">1:32 pm, third floor, the wooden table in the corner, basked by the midday light shone through by the large window, my drink, bitten paper straw, half finished, empty water cup,</p>
            <p class="review-text">it is the masked tranquility, bloomed on this concrete third floor, devoid of the busy talking and terrible music blasted two levels below it, that has made this spot a perfect hidden time cocoon stowed away on one of the most bustling street of the city,</p>
            <p class="review-text">cong is famed for their coconut cream cafe, and it is undeniable that they do it quite well, but for me their vina latte, which sounds basic and it is basic by nature, is ideal for midday lingering,</p>
            <p class="review-text">the bitter taste of espresso, fused out by the emphasized layering taste of fresh milk, frothed, a small cup of syrup is provided on the side, but the bitter taste is better suited for thoughts.</p>
            <p class="review-text">the serene hours, oranged honey hue, all with the comfort of being hidden, and air conditioned, is why cộng in nha trang, on nguyen thien thuat street, on the third floor, the window table, made it to the list.</p>
            <p class="review-text small-spacing">thân,</p>
